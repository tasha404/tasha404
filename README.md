## Hi!
I’m Tasha, a Computer Science student who loves turning ideas into real, working tech projects. I enjoy building intelligent systems — from AI-powered applications to creative web platforms — and exploring how technology can solve real-world problems.

I’ve worked on projects like AI-based detection systems and interactive web applications, and I’m especially interested in machine learning, automation, and smart systems. I’m constantly learning, experimenting, and improving my skills to grow as a developer in the AI space.

Beyond coding, I enjoy creating aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly designs. I love combining tech with creativity — whether it’s designing fun web apps, customizing UI/UX, or building projects that feel both smart and beautiful.

In my free time, I enjoy learning new technologies, refining my coding skills, and working on creative side projects. When I’m not in tech mode, you’ll probably find me exploring Korean skincare, reading on my Kindle, taking cute pictures, or enjoying a good cup of strawberry buttercream latte ♡
